        <h1>Hello.</h1>
        <p>This state has it all - from mountain peaks and forests filled with great snow to red rock archways and canyons and everything in between. Discover one of our 15 world-class resorts or one of our five iconic national parks and rejuvenate your soul. We’re sorry. We know it’s not fair. But hey, Utah is landlocked, so it doesn't have beaches. (No, wait. It does.)</p>

        <h2>3 Must See Places</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>The Narrows</dt>
            <dd>The Narrows is the narrowest section of Zion Canyon. This gorge, with walls a thousand feet tall and the river sometimes just twenty to thirty feet wide, is one of the most popular areas in Zion National Park. You can see The Narrows by hiking along the paved, wheelchair accessible Riverside Walk for one mile from the Temple of Sinawava. If you wish to see more, you will be walking in the Virgin River. This can involve wading upstream for just a few minutes or it can be an all day hike.</dd>
            <dt>Bear Lake State Park</dt> 
            <dd>The Bear Lake Valley is a recreational paradise! Bear Lake is often called “Caribbean of the Rockies” for its intense turquoise blue water. Jet ski, go sailing, boating, fish, swim and play on our sandy beaches. Winter offers snowmobiling, ice fishing and snow skiing.</dd>
            <dt>Goblin Valley State Park</dt>
            <dd>Journey to this strange and colorful valley, which is unlike any other in Utah. The landscape, covered with sandstone goblins and formations, is often compared to Mars. Explore the geology, and camp among the nooks and gnomes.</dd>
